Capstone Project - Wordpress on AWS - darey.io
# WordPress Site on AWS - High Performance Infrastructure

## Project Overview
I designed and implemented a highly available, secure, and scalable WordPress infrastructure on AWS for DigitalBoost, a digital marketing agency. This solution leverages various AWS services to create a robust, production-ready WordPress hosting environment.

## Architecture Highlights
- **High Availability**: Deployed across 2 availability zones for fault tolerance
- **Security**: Multi-layered security with public and private subnets
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling configuration for handling traffic spikes
- **Performance**: Load balanced architecture with optimized database setup
- **Cost Efficiency**: Resource optimization while maintaining performance

## Key Components

### 1. VPC Setup
- Created a custom VPC with public and private subnets across 2 availability zones
- Implemented separate route tables for public and private subnets
- Configured Internet Gateway for public internet access

### 2. Network Security
- Deployed NAT Gateways in public subnets for private subnet internet access
- Implemented security groups with principle of least privilege
- Configured the following security group rules:
  - ALB: Ports 80 and 443 for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - SSH: Port 22 for secure admin access
  - Web Servers: Ports 80/443 from ALB only
  - Database: Port 3306 restricted to web server access
  - EFS: Port 2049 for file system access

### 3. Database Layer
- Implemented MySQL RDS in a Multi-AZ configuration
- Configured standby database for failover
- Placed database instances in private subnets for security
- Optimized for WordPress workloads

### 4. File Storage
- Deployed Amazon EFS for WordPress media files
- Configured mount targets in each availability zone
- Implemented shared storage for consistent content across instances

### 5. Load Balancing
- Set up Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Configured health checks for instance monitoring
- Implemented SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer

### 6. Auto Scaling
- Created Auto Scaling group for WordPress instances
- Implemented scaling policies based on CPU utilization
- Configured launch templates with WordPress optimization

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Knowledge of TechOps Essentials
- Completion of Core 2 Courses and Mini Projects
- Basic understanding of WordPress administration

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive resources placed in private subnets
- Security groups configured with minimal required access
- Regular security patches and updates strategy
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Performance Features
- Content distribution optimization
- Database query optimization
- Auto-scaling for traffic management
- Load balancing for even distribution

## Project Outcomes
- Successfully deployed a highly available WordPress infrastructure
- Implemented comprehensive security measures
- Achieved scalability goals with auto-scaling configuration
- Created a cost-effective and maintainable solution

## Future Improvements
- Implement CloudFront for global content delivery
- Add WAF for enhanced security
- Implement automated backup solutions
- Set up monitoring and alerting with CloudWatch
